# üì° FTTR_50G_10G-PON_WiFi_MLO - Simplifying Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation

[![Download FTTR_50G_10G-PON_WiFi_MLO](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-FTTR_50G_10G--PON_WiFi_MLO-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ioanghisoiu/FTTR_50G_10G-PON_WiFi_MLO/releases)

## üìñ About

FTTR_50G_10G-PON_WiFi_MLO is an event-driven simulation designed to showcase how dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) works in a Fiber-To-The-Room (FTTR) network. This network features a 50 Gbps Gigabit Passive Optical Network (50G-PON) with a split ratio of 1:16 and a 10G-PON with a split ratio of 1:8. It also incorporates WiFi-7 multi-link operation (MLO). This simulation helps visualize the allocation of resources within complex fiber networks effectively.
