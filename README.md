# FTTR_50G_10G-PON_WiFi_MLO
About This is an event-driven simulation of dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) in Fiber-To-The-Room (FTTR) network, where the External PON is a 50 Gbps Gigabit Passive Optical Network (50G-PON) with split-ratio 1:16 and the Internal PON is a 10G-PON with split-ratio 1:8 with WiFi-7 multi-link operation (MLO). Note that MAC is abstracted.
